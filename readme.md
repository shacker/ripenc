# RipEnc for BeOS - "Ripless" MP3 encoding, ID3 tagging, and databasing

In the BeOS glory days, the RipEnc shell script was the premiere MP3 ripping/encoding solution, and made full use of the database-like BeOS filesystem to store MP3 metadata. After I left the BeOS world, others took over the script. The version here is the last one created and maintained by me.

I'd consider this code fairly useless now. It is made available here for posterity and is licensed under the MIT License - feel free to copy, redistribute, etc.
