<h1>RipEnc: Optional Scripts</h1>
	
There are three extra scripts in this folder, mostly for geeks and special purposes. They're not well honed and I offer no guarantees or warrantees. Be careful! To use a script, move it to ~/config/bin and type its name from Terminal.

<h3>AddMP3Index</h3>

This is the same script that gets run the first time you run RipEnc. Its purpose is to add indexes to a filesystem corresponding to the MP3 attributes in the FileTypes panel, so you can search that volume on arbitrary criteria.
<P>
Use this script if you have more than one BFS volume, such as one you might be using for MP3 storage. Open a Terminal, cd to your new MP3 volume, e.g.:

<pre>cd /mp3</pre>

and type AddMP3Index. The alert boxes will guide you. You may see some error messages if you try to add an index where you've already got one. 

<h3>ProcessTracks</h3>

This script is useful if you've got a lot of pre-existing MP3s and you haven't been religiously setting your MP3 attributes all along, or if you transfer your files to a non-attribute-savvy filesystem, then back to BeOS, and want your attributes back. <i>It will only work with files that already have ID3 tags.</i>
<P>
It works by finding a list of all MP3 files in a given directory structure, then making sure each one has the correct MIME type (audio/x-mpeg), then copying those files' ID3 tags to attributes and adding appropriate indexes to disk volumes if necessary. <tt>processtracks</tt> depends on the presence of <a href="http://www.bebits.com/app/395">id3attr</a> being  in your path. Edit the first line of <tt>processtracks</tt> before running it and make sure the path is the shortest path to an MP3 storage location.


<h3>TestEnc</h3>

TestEnc will generate a pile of MP3s of the same input file at different bitrates so you can run bitrate/quality comparisons. Current output bitrates are 64 96 128 160 192 256. You can change that by editing this line in the script:

<pre>for i in 64 96 128 160 192 256; do</pre>
<P>
Run TestEnc from the working directory with the input filename as an argument, but leave off the .wav extenstion.  e.g. If you want to encode noseblow.wav, run:

<pre>TestEnc noseblow</pre>

If your input filename has spaces in it, remember to enclose the filename in 'strong quotes' on the command line.
